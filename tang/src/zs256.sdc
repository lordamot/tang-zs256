// The design has ONE internal clock, and that is the whole point of its
// clocking: 42 MHz out of the PLL, everything on it, the CPU's T-state
// and the machine's pixel counted as phases of it (top.v).  The HDMI
// serial clock is derived by the tool itself from the rPLL in
// hdmi_serdes.v with this clock as its reference (210 MHz, generated),
// and the MCU's SPI clock is asynchronous to all of it and crosses
// through the handshake in mcu_spi.v.  Korvet Nano's three lines, with
// the period changed (.claude/rules/timing.md).
//
// The tool's own derived clock on the PLL pin is replaced by the named
// one below, because timing_check.py wants the name.  Only CLKOUT
// reaches logic; CLKOUTP goes to the SDRAM pad alone.

// The MCU's SPI link.  m0s[3] is the BL616's SPI clock, 20 MHz
// (mnano/spi.c), into a general I/O pin: PR1014 in the log says so and
// timing_check.py knows the net.  Mode 1: the MCU sets up MOSI and reads
// MISO on the FALLING edge, the FPGA shifts MOSI in on the falling edge
// and drives MISO on the rising one.  The delays are the BL616's, not
// measured: 5 ns out, 5 ns of setup, 2 ns of cable each way, as bounds.
